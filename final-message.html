      <p>Someone asked me recently, why do you love her and don’t say cuz she’s hot or nice or caring , look deeper.</p>
      <p>The person you love is also the person who triggers you the most, and it’s not a coincidence it’s how love actually works, as my partner you’re not meant to just make me happy, you’re there to show me parts of myself I didn’t know existed, the parts I’ve been avoiding, the wounds that haven’t healed, the patterns i keep repeating. The way you challenge me, the way you make me feel exposed and vulnerable, that’s not a problem with our relationship, it’s love doing its job. Real love doesn’t just comfort you, it forces you to change and grow, it holds up a mirror to your habits and deepest fears. It makes you confront the parts of yourself you ignore. That’s why relationships r so hard, you’re not just dealing with another person but the parts of you they bring out in you that you thought you had handled. Love isn’t meant to be easy it’s meant to change you. And I know I love you because it’s what makes me not want to stop ever. It’s what inspires me to be better for us. Even when people roll their eyes or call me crazy or you push me away even then especially then, love shows up in moments when it’s not expected to. Love isn’t just a feeling, it’s what you do in spite of what you feel, you just don’t give up, Real love doesn’t walk away it knocks until you’re brave enough to open the door because if I could give up and listen to everyone then it wasn’t really love and deep down I know what I feel for you. I know that I don’t just love you, I’m devoted to you. When I really think about it, I fell for you twice. I didn’t just fall for the loving caring beautiful parts of you, I also fell for the part of you that you hide from most people, the part of you that’s both good and bad. But irregardless of all that I still choose you.I choose you in this life and the next, In every conceivable timeline or reality I CHOOSE YOU. You are the piece that completes me, the center of my attention, the thing which i hold dearest to my heart. My gift that keeps on giving.</p>
      <p> I love you deeply, not just for who you are now, but for who I know you’re becoming. I understand my faults and the part they played in our breakup. You were right to feel what you felt and to react the way you did. Understanding you, your emotions, your heart, your entire being ,has always been my greatest joy and my purpose. Becoming the man worthy of you is my mission. If the time ever comes, I pray I’ll have the chance to prove that with my actions. You are, and always will be, the person I choose. I hope this space gives you the clarity to see that too, and maybe, one day, to find your way back to me. But i vow this to you, If you find it in you to forgive me for the part i played, eventhough i know im undeserving of it, and give me one more chance at our love, I will love you in ways that have never been seen. I will give it everything i possibly have in me to make this work and lay it all out for you everyday for the rest of our lives. Because when it really comes down to it, I just want to be yours.  </p>
      <p> I’ll end it with this saying:  The grass isn’t greener on the other side — it’s greener wherever you water it.</p>
